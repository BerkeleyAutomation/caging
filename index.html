<p>
    An object is caged by an obstacle configuration if it cannot escape.
    Cages do not necessarily immobilize an object and therefore may be robust to uncertainty in object pose and shape.
    However, bounding all object motions may not always be necessary to manipulate an object.
    For example, humans naturally place objects in containers such as bowls that restrict and object's motions under gravity, such as when a waiter carries a set of dishes.
    To formally capture this notion, we define energy-bounded cages under a constant potential energy field (e.g. gravity) by the ability of an object to escape a gripper without exceeding an energy threshold, and measure these cages by the minimum energy required to escape.
    We introduce Energy-Bounded-Cage-Analysis-2D (EBCA-2D), a provably-correct sampling-based algorithm that computes a lower bound on the minimum escape energy for a planar configuration of rigid polygonal obstacles (e.g. gripper jaws, walls, tables) and a rigid polygonal object in the plane.
    Our algorithm runs in O(N^2 \log(1 / D) + N V^3 ) time, where N is the number of samples used, V is the sum of all vertices between the object and obstacles, and D is the resolution of energy values to search over.
    While we cannot guarantee the tightness of our lower bound at this time, we find that EBCA-2D returns a nontrivial bound on a test set of nine parallel-jaw gripper configurations and four configurations of nonconvex obstacles across six nonconvex polygonal objects under a gravitational potential energy field.
    We also find that an RRT* planner is not able to find an escape path with lower energy than our estimated lower bound in all test cases.
    Our algorithm runs in approximately 3 minutes on a single machine, motivating future Cloud-based parallel implementations.
