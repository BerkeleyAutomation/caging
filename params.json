We present two novel devices to facilitate automation. The first is a low-cost 3d-printed single-use instrument mount that uses the gripping action of a standard RMIS instrument to securely hold and manipulate a range of standard instruments such as scalpels and novel instruments such as palpation probes. The second is a needle injection system designed to facilitate precision injection of chemotherapies, stem cells, adhesives, and other fluidic material to specific internal targets. The single-use needle is attached using the interchangeable instrument mount and the fluid flow through the needle is controlled via an externally-mounted automated lead screw. To explore how the mounting and injection system perform, we combined them with a palpation probe and scalpel to automate tumor resection: a common multi-step surgical procedure to locate, expose, and debride a subcutaneous tumor and seal the resulting wound with adhesive. This paper reports details on the design, implementation, and initial experiments with custom phantom tissues.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n- **Winner:** [**Hamlyn Challenge 2015**](http://hamlyn.doc.ic.ac.uk/hsmr/events/surgical-robot-challenge-2015) **Video Award.** \\[[**Youtube**](https://youtu.be/YiPq9t0tR3U)\\]\r\n- A Disposable Haptic Palpation Probe for Locating Subcutaneous Blood Vessels in Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery\r\nStephen McKinley, Animesh Garg, Siddarth Sen, Rishi Kapadia, Adithyavairavan Murali, Kirk Nichols, Susan Lim, Sachin Patil, Pieter Abbeel, Allison M.
