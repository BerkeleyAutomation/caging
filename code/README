This code accompanies the submission "Energy-Bounded Caging: Formal Definition and 2D Energy Lower Bound Algorithm Based on Weighted Alpha Shapes," currently under review for Robtics & Automation Letters, 2016


DESCRIPTION:

This project is ongoing research on using alpha shapes and persistent homology for proving
path existence / nonexistence. It was adapted from Zoe McCarthy's work at UIUC on path planning:

McCarthy, Zoe, Timothy Bretl, and Seth Hutchinson. "Proving path non-existence using sampling and alpha shapes."
Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2012 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2012.

The current focus of the project is to extend these techniques to prove whether or not a gripepr configuration
"cages" an object and if this cannot be determined, to what extent is the object caged?

VERSION 0.0 (Zoe Mccarthy):

This project is an ongoing research project for a hybrid PRM for robotic motion planning.
The goal is to have a PRM planner infused with the ability to halt if it detects that no path exists.
This is a feature that most sampling based motion planners lack, and adding it will hopefully allow
for a range of applications that require speedy determination of feasible motion queries.
It will be able to support robots with 3 degrees of freedom, due to the support in CGAL for only
2D and 3D alpha shapes, which are the basis for path non existence proving in the planner.
It provides tools for visualizing the robot, obstacles, and planner.

INSTALLATION:

Libraries required for installation and usage:
- CGAL
- SOLID collision detection
- QHULL
- CGAL's geomview stream (will only work in linux)
